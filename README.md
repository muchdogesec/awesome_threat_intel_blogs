## Miscellaneous

### Finding feed URLs

Many feeds paths can be guessed when a standard blog framework is used. e.g by appending the following to the URL path;

* `/feed`
* `/rss`

Typically, but not always, feed URLs are also reported in the source code of the blog;

Right-click -> View Page Source -> Ctrl+f `atom` or `rss`

In some cases, blog categories have their own feeds so don't forget to check these if you only want a certain category of posts.

### Dealing with blogs with no feeds

There are tons of services that will create feeds from websites, Google; "create rss feed for a website".

For example; https://rss.app/

I can't recommend any, but on cursory testing they appear to pretty good at creating live feeds for blogs and Twitter feeds.
